# Raserhin's solutions for Project Euler

This repository has been created to keep track of all my solutions of the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

Keep in mind that this repository may lack some (or most) problems. And although I try my best to optimize the algorithms used, the solutions could be far from perfect.

## Current state

As the time of updating this `README` the current state of the problems are the following.

```txt
C = correct, I = incorrect, E = error, S = skipped, . = missing

Problems 001-020: C C C C C   C C C C C   C C C C C   C C C C C

Problems 061-080: . . . . .   . C I . .   . . . . .   . . . . .  

```

This information has been gathered with the help of the [EulerPy](https://github.com/iKevinY/EulerPy) package.

## Acknowledge

For this creation I have used very heavily the package [EulerPy](https://github.com/iKevinY/EulerPy) made by [@iKevinY](https://github.com/iKevinY). For both the creation of the templates problems, checking the results and testing.
